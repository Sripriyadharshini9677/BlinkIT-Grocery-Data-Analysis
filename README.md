## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is **BlinkIT Grocery Data.xlsx**.  
It contains detailed information on grocery items including:

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Item Identifier | Unique ID for each item |
| Item Weight | Weight of the product |
| Item Fat Content | Fat type (Low Fat / Regular) |
| Item Visibility | Percentage visibility in store |
| Item Type | Category of grocery item |
| Item MRP | Maximum Retail Price |
| Outlet Identifier | Store code |
| Outlet Establishment Year | Year the store was opened |
| Outlet Size | Store size (Small/Medium/Large) |
| Outlet Location Type | Tier of city |
| Outlet Type | Type of outlet (Grocery Store / Supermarket) |
| Item Outlet Sales | Total sales for the item |

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze item sales across different outlet types and locations.  
- Identify correlation between **MRP**, **visibility**, and **sales**.  
- Compare performance of **low-fat** vs **regular** products.  
- Visualize overall sales distribution and category insights.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Supermarket Type 3** outlets generate the highest sales.  
- **Medium-sized stores** have more consistent performance across categories.  
- Higher **MRP items** tend to show moderate sales; discounts play a major role.  
- **Regular fat content** products outperform low-fat ones.  

---

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing and duplicate values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions and relationships between features.  
3. **Statistical Insights:** Used correlation matrices to identify significant predictors of sales.  
4. **Visualization:** Created bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps for better understanding.

---

## 📊 Visualizations (Sample)
- Item Type vs Average Sales  
- Outlet Type vs Total Sales  
- Correlation Heatmap for numeric columns  
- Item Fat Content comparison  

---

## 🧠 Future Scope
- Apply **Machine Learning** to predict item sales.  
- Perform **time-series forecasting** if temporal data is available.  
- Build a **dashboard** using Power BI or Streamlit for interactive insights.
